# kudzu

A ClojureScript DSL for writing glsl (specifically, glsl 300 es, for use in webgl2). Originally forked from [iglu](https://github.com/oakes/iglu).

Created primarily for use within [hollow](https://github.com/Ella-Hoeppner/hollow/tree/main), a ClojureScript graphics library built on top of webgl2. However, this library can be used independently from hollow.

See src/kudzu/examples.cljs for some simple examples of the syntax, or the [hollow demos](https://github.com/Ella-Hoeppner/hollow/tree/main/src/hollow/demos) for some more sophisticated examples of full shaders.

Most of the commit history is in [hollow](https://github.com/Ella-Hoeppner/hollow/tree/main), as the two libraries were developed in a single repo before being separated.

Created by [Ella Hoeppner](https://github.com/Ella-Hoeppner) and [Fay Carsons](https://github.com/FayCarsons).
