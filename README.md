# kudzu

A ClojureScript DSL for writing glsl (specifically, glsl 300 es, for use in webgl2). Originally forked from [iglu](https://github.com/oakes/iglu).

Created primarily for use within [sprog](https://github.com/Ella-Hoeppner/sprog/tree/main), a clojurescript graphics library built on top of webgl2. However, this library can be used independently from sprog.

See src/kudzu/examples.cljs for some trivial examples, or the [sprog demos](https://github.com/Ella-Hoeppner/sprog/tree/main/src/sprog/demos) for some more sophisticated examples.

Most of the commit history is in [sprog], as the two libraries were developed in a single repo for most of the development history.
